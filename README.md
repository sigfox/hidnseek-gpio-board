## SIGFOX GPIO Extension Board for the HidnSeek

This repo contains the .brd and .sch files required for the HidnSeek GPIO Extension Board. The design utilises a PCF8574N to breakout the i2c pins and allow for 8 additional digital I/O pins. The board also consists of a reset button to place the device into DFU mode for reflashing.

The intension of this board is to allow developers and makers to utilise the underlying hardware and to expand it with their own designs.
