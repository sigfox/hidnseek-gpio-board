## SIGFOX GPIO Extension Board for the HidnSeek

This repo contains the .brd and .sch files required for the HidnSeek GPIO Extension Board. The design utilises a PCF8574N to breakout the i2c pins and allow for 8 additional digital I/O pins. The board also contains a reset button to place the device into DFU mode for re-flashing.

The intention of this board is to allow developers and makers to utilise the underlying hardware and to expand it with their own designs.
